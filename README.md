# Tom's Ultimate C ADT Library 🚀  

Welcome to **Tom’s Ultimate C ADT Library!** This is your go-to collection of high-performance, reusable data structures written in pure C. Designed for efficiency, ease of use, and flexibility, these ADTs help you streamline your projects without the hassle of reinventing the wheel.  

## 📌 What's Inside?  

This library features a set of powerful, well-tested Abstract Data Types (ADTs), each with a clean, consistent API. Here's what you get:  

- **Dynamic Array** – Fast, flexible, and memory-efficient.  
- **Linked List** _(Coming soon!)_ – Because sometimes arrays just don’t cut it.  
- **Stack** _(Coming soon!)_ – Push, pop, and conquer.  
- **Queue** _(Coming soon!)_ – First in, first out, no stress.  
- **Hash Table** _(Coming soon!)_ – O(1) lookups for the win!  
- **AVL Tree** _(Coming soon!)_ – Self-balancing, because balance matters.  
- ...and more!  

Each ADT is implemented as a modular, standalone component with a clear and intuitive interface. Whether you’re building system-level software or just need a rock-solid data structure, this library has you covered.  

## 💡 Why Use This Library?  
- 🔥 **Performance-Oriented** – Optimized for speed and memory efficiency.  
- 🛠 **Easy to Integrate** – Drop it into any C project with minimal setup.  
- 📚 **Well-Documented API** – Clean, consistent function signatures.  
- 🏗 **Extensible** – Designed to be easily modifiable and extendable.  

Stay tuned for updates as new ADTs roll out! 🚧
